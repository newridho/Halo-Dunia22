## Avoid Conflicts {Syncing your fork}

An easy way to avoid conflicts is to add an 'upstream' for your git repo, as other PR's may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.   

```terminal
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ossamamehmood/Hacktoberfest2023
```

You can verify that the new remote has been added by typing
```terminal
git remote -v
```

To pull any new changes from your parent repo simply run
```terminal
git merge upstream/main
```

This will give you any eventual conflicts and allow you to easily solve them in your repo. It's a good idea to use it frequently in between your own commits to make sure that your repo is up to date with its parent.
